          <h3 class="textSheet__title">Lifetime Warranty</h3>
          <p class="textSheet__text">
            Smurfs.lol cares for its customers, which is why we provide a
            warranty on each account. If an account purchased from us is banned
            by Riot Games, one new account will be provided. This warranty is
            subject to the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ol class="textSheet__text numbersListing">
            <li>
              A copy of the ban notice and reason for the ban is forwarded to
              support@smurfs.lol within 15 (fifteen) days of the ban.
            </li>
            <li>
              That the reason for the ban is either “Purchase of an account” or
              “Use of a 3rd party program to level to 30” or the substantial
              equivalent.
            </li>
            <li>The account has played at least one match AFTER purchase.</li>
            <li>
              You have not already received a replacement account from us.
            </li>
            <li>
              You changed the registered email address & password after
              purchasing the account and BEFORE playing any games. The process
              for this is clearly laid out in your welcome/purchase email.
            </li>
            <li>
              The account was not transferred from the region in which it was
              originally located.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="textSheet__text">
            If any of these conditions are not met, the warranty will not apply.
            The warranty will never apply to bans that are due to your own
            behavior, which include, but are not limited to, bad behavior,
            hacking, or excessive cursing. There is a limit of one account
            replacement per account purchased. Riot Points spent on accounts
            that are subsequently banned will not be refunded under any
            circumstances, even if a new account is awarded. We only offer
            replacement for banned accounts - no refunds will be made.
